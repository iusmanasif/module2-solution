module 2 - assignment solution

## objectives achived
1. Does the implementation use a CSS or Javascript framework (not allowed)?
1. Does the implementation use inline CSS (not allowed) or reference a CSS file instead?
1. Does the implemented layout conform to the provided mockup illustrations for desktop, tablet, and mobile views?
1. Does the section title region always appear in the top right corner of the section region, no matter what view is being displayed (desktop, tablet, or mobile)?
1. Is there padding separating the dummy text from the edges of the section? Is the dummy text pushed down such that it doesnâ€™t overlap the section title region?
1. Are the borders and colors implemented according the stated requirements?

## objectives not achived
1. Is there consistent horizontal spacing between the section regions and browser edges (especially in the desktop and tablet views) and consistent vertical spacing between the regions (especially in the tablet and mobile views)?

## known bugs:
1. sub menu title's top and right border is not sinked with outer border
1. box-spacing is not implemented perfectly so when user shrinks or spreads browser window spacing and lignment are not consistent
